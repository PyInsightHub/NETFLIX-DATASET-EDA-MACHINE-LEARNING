# 🎬 Netflix Data Analytics & Machine Learning Project

---
# 📌 Project Overview

*This project presents an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning pipeline built on a real-world Netflix dataset.*
*The objective is to extract meaningful insights from Netflix content data and build regression models to predict Movie duration and TV Show duration (seasons) using engineered features.*

*The workflow covers data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, regression modeling, and model evaluation.*

# 🧠 Key Objectives

*Perform structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

*Understand content trends over time*

*Engineer meaningful features from categorical data*

*Build and evaluate regression models*

*Select and visualize the best-performing models*

# 🤖 Machine Learning Workflow
**1️⃣ Movie Duration Regression**

*Prepared ML-ready dataset with engineered features*

*Trained and evaluated three regression models*

*Compared models using standard regression metrics*

*Visualized predictions and residuals*

*Selected the best-performing model*

**2️⃣ TV Show Duration Regression**

*Prepared a separate dataset for TV Shows*

*Trained and evaluated three regression models*

*Selected and visualized the best TV Show duration model*

**📊 Model Evaluation Metrics**

*Models were evaluated using:*

*MAE (Mean Absolute Error)*

*MSE (Mean Squared Error)*

*RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)*

*R² Score*

*Visual comparisons were used to assess model performance and stability.*
